## **RESEARCH EXPERIENCE**

**Stem Cell and lncRNA**                                                                                                                 Aug. 2017-Jun. 2018

*Advisor: Prof. Wei Jiang, Whuhan University*

- a lncRNA that specifically appears in the definitive endoderm (DE) stage, DEANR1 (LINC00261), promotes expression of the transcription factor FOXA2 by recruiting Smad2/3 to the FOXA2 promoter, thereby promoting hESCs to DE Stage differentiation. Screening diabetes-related SNP in the GWAS database, we found that a SNP (major A, minor G) on the DEANR1 promoter is highly correlated with fasting blood glucose abnormalities. By detecting the differentiation efficiency of A/A or G/G in the process of pancreas differentiation, we can explore the effect of this SNP on the development of pancreas and whether or not this SNP contributes to the occurrence of hyperglycemia

 

**Use CRISPR/cas13 to identify RNA binding protein**                                                           Oct. 2018-May. 2019

*Advisor: Prof. Xuerui Yang, Tsinghua University*

- To reveal the composition and dynamics of specific noncoding RNA-protein complexes in vivo, we develop a method which can enrich and identify the RNA binding proteins, based on CRISPR/cas13, a system can specifically target and degrade the interest RNA. We mutant amino acid at some motifs responsible for nuclease, by which we can obtain nuclease-free dcas13 protein simply to target interest RNA. Fuse the affinity protein tag with dcas13 protein, enrich the dcas13 protein by immunoprecipitation when CRISPR/cas13 have been attached to interest RNA, then identify unknown RBPs by Western blot or Mass spectrometry

 

**single cell RNA-seq data analysis using Seurat and monocle.**                                       Jul. 2019-Sep. 2019

*Advisor: Prof. Xun Lan, Tsinghua University*

- The lab perform 10X single-cell RNA sequencing on cells isolated from peripheral blood, tumor, and adjacent normal tissues from ten Gastric carcinoma patients. I use Seurat analysis pipline to analyze several patients, identify cancer-related cell from normal cell, perform GO enrichment and KEGG analysis, and use R package inferCNV to calculate cnv score for confirming the cancer-related cluster.

- **Biochemistry Experiment**: Western Blot, Co-IP, Protein purification.

- **Bioinformatic analysis:** Single cell RNA-seq analysis by Seurat and monocle using R language and  linux.
